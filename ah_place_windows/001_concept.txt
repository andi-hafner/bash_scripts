Saving and restoring window positions under the X Window System by the
command line, GPLv3 swalt.org 2016.

Description of the concept and the development of an appropriate script. The
command line tool for controlling windows I use is wmctrl, for its
basic syntax please consult 'man wmctrl'.

The idea is the following:

1. Placing the windows graphically with the mouse

2. Storing their positions to a file with wmctrl 

3. Automatically set the windows positions by loading the previously gathered
		file with wmctrl


Unfortunately wmctrl produces a window list which is different from what it expects
as input format to set the windows positions, as explained below, so we have to do
some string manipulations, some sort of "word processing", you know ;-)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Arrange the windows graphically with the mouse until the layout fits your
		needs

2. 'wmctrl -lG' delivers something like this:

		0x07800011  0 3587 171  882  1102 core-i7 Firefox

which is essentially ok, although, as already mentioned above, it doesn't fit
 	the input format which wmctrl is expecting, which should look like this:

		wmctrl -r Firefox -e "0,30,30,1717,1083" 
	
Therefore we have to transform the given output in a appropriate manner. As
	this task requires several steps, it resides in a seperate file named
	ah_transforming_steps.txt.
	
Currently sometimes after placing the windows with wmctrl there is a mess
	with wrong placed windows which aren't responding correctly to mouse
	input, at least under the unity Desktop, other Desktops I didn't test so far.
	
At least the windows responding issue can be fixed by reloading the windows
	manager (in case of unity: 'compiz --replace &'). Don't forget the plus sign
	unless you rest with a unresponsive UI in case you shut down the window 
	manager in the shell.
