Saving and restoring window positions under the X Window System by the
command line, GPLv3 swalt.org 2016.

Description of the concept and the development of the appropriate script. The
command line tool for controlling windows in this case is wmctrl, for its
basic syntax please consult 'man wmctrl'.

The idea is the following:

1. Placing the windows graphically with the mouse

2. Storing their positions to a file with wmctrl 

3. Automatically set the windows positions by loading the previously gathered
		file with wmctrl

Unfortunately the output format of wmctrl doesn't fit the required input
	syntax of wmctrl, so it's essential to transform the file with the help of
	GNU tools like 'cut' into the appropriate form.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Arrange the windows graphically with the mouse until the layout fits your
		needs

2. 'wmctrl -lG' delivers something like this:

		0x07800011  0 3587 171  882  1102 core-i7 Firefox

which is essentially ok, although, as already mentioned above, it doesn't fit
 	the output format which wmctrl is expecting, which should look like this:

		wmctrl -r Firefox -e "0,30,30,1717,1083" 
	
Therefore we have to transform the given output in a appropriate manner. As
	this task requires several steps, it resides in a seperate file named
	ah_transforming_steps.txt.
	
Currently sometimes after placing the windows with wmctrl there is a mess
	with not correct paced windows and windows not responding correctly to mouse
	input, at least under the unity Desktop, other Desktops I didn't test so far.
	
At least the windows responding issue can be fixed by reloading the windows
	manager (in case of unity: 'compiz --replace &'). Don't forget the plus sign
	unless you rest with a unresponsive UI in case you interrupt the window 
	manager in the shell.
